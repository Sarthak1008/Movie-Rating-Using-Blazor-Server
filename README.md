# Movie-Rating-Using-Blazor-Server

A basic movie rating Blazor Server project is a web application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movies and their ratings. The project utilizes the Blazor Server framework, which combines C# on the server-side with a dynamic and interactive user interface on the client-side.

Here's a brief description of the main components and functionality of the project:

Movie Management: Users can add new movies to the system by providing details such as title, genre, release date, and synopsis. The application stores this information in a database.

Movie Listing: The application displays a list of all movies available in the database. Users can view the details of each movie, including its title, genre, release date, synopsis, and average rating.

Rating System: Users can rate movies on a scale, such as a star rating or a numerical rating. They can provide their rating and optionally leave a review or comment. The application calculates and displays the average rating for each movie based on user inputs.

CRUD Operations: Users have the ability to edit existing movie details, delete movies, or update movie ratings. These CRUD operations ensure the user can manage and maintain an up-to-date movie database.

User Interface: The project uses the Blazor framework to create an interactive and responsive user interface. Users can navigate between different pages, interact with forms, and receive real-time updates without the need for page refreshes.

Overall, this basic movie rating Blazor Server project provides a platform for users to manage a movie database, rate movies, and perform CRUD operations on movies and ratings. It offers an intuitive user interface and ensures data security through user authentication.
